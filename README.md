My project is a Security Surveillance System with built-in light sensors, that will monitor and detect any face or body and at detection, start recording until such time that there is no detection. When there is nothing being detected while in recording, it will continue recording for at least 5 to 10 seconds, and stop recording when that time lapses.
The entire purpose or the reason why I went with such a project was because, we South Africans are currently experiencing quite a lot of loadshedding and as a result, crime rate, such as house break-ins is sky-rocketing. Hence, the cameras have built-in lights with sensors, that were meant to come on or be activated immediately when loadshedding is implemented.
